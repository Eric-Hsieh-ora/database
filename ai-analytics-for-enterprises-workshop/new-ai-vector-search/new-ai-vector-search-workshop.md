# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GenAI Service and Oracle 23ai

## Introduction

- How Oracle Gen AI service and Oracle 23ai can be used within LangChain framework
- How to leverage Oracle 23ai's AI Vector Search and Graph to perform Advanced RAG
- How to use Oracle GenAI service to create an chat that answers questions intelligently using private information stored in Oracle 23ai 
- Look at the multi-lingual capability of Oracle GenAI Service

**We are also going to use an AI Agent in the lab:**
- Langchain Agent Framework
- Structed Chat ReAct Agent
- Agent Tools

**_Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes_**

## Task 1: Login the Data Science environment
1. Click [this link] (https://objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/n/hutchhk/b/AIWorkshop/o/notebook-workshop.zip) to download the zip file with our notebook setup materials.

2. Unzip the files. You should see these files available.

## Task 2. Import the Data science notebook

1. In Into the Data Science Notebook Lab. You can extend the session first. Then upload this file that we downloaded and unzip.

    ![Extend session and upload file](images/6-extend-upload-workshop.png " ")

    Select the file and upload.
    ![Extend session and upload file](images/7-select-file-workshop.png " ")

    You can see the uploaded file in console.

3. Entry the notebook and start ot run the notebook.
    ![Start to execute the notebook script](images/12-start-notebook-workshop.png " ")

6. Let's start to run the notebook.

## Task 3: Integrate JSON, Graph, GenAI and 23ai Vector Search

After you have opened the notebook, you can press the **Shift+Enter** to execute the notebook script step by step.  

In this notebook, we are are going to show you:

- How Oracle Gen AI service and Oracle 23ai can be used within LangChain framework
- How to leverage Oracle 23ai's AI Vector Search and Graph to perform Advanced RAG
- How to use Oracle GenAI service to create an chat that answers questions intelligently using private information stored in Oracle 23ai 
- Look at the multi-lingual capability of Oracle GenAI Service

We are also going to use an AI Agent in the lab:  
- Langchain Agent Framework
- Structed Chat ReAct Agent
- Agent Tools

### The notebook has 2 main sections
* Oracle 23ai Vector Search with Document Processing
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen AI Service
### Now, let's switch to the notebook for further instructions and have some fun!
