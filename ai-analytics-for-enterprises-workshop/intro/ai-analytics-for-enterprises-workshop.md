# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop briefly introduces you to the JSON Duality View feature, working with Property Graphs, Vector DB in Oracle Database 23ai Free. You will create a graph from two tables, one containing bank account information, and another containing bank transactions information.  You will then run graph pattern queries in SQL on this graph.   You will find circular payment chains, multi-hop paths between accounts, and more.

### **JSON Duality** **_Estimated Time: 20 minutes_**

JSON Relational Duality in Oracle Database 23c:

- Innovative feature bridging document and relational database models
- Offers flexibility of JSON documents with efficiency of relational storage
- Simplifies app development by eliminating data structure and mapping concerns
- Implemented through JSON Relational Duality View
- Unique solution praised by industry experts for addressing object-relational mismatch

This feature allows developers to leverage the best of both document and relational worlds, streamlining database management and application development.

### Objectives

About JSON-relational duality views -> This workshop aims to provide hands-on experience with JSON-relational duality views, demonstrating how to get the strengths of both JSON and relational data models. You will learn how to create, query, and update JSON-relational duality views using SQL and REST.


### **Property Graphs** **_Estimated Time: 30 minutes_**
In Oracle Database 23ai the GRAPH_TABLE function and MATCH clause of the new SQL:2023 standard enable you to write simple SQL queries to follow connections in data.  This workshop illustrates how you can model your data as a graph and run graph queries in SQL to quickly see relationships in your data that are difficult to identify otherwise.



### Objectives

About Operational Property Graphs -> In this lab, you will :
* Create a PROPERTY GRAPH from relational tables
* Run graph pattern queries in SQL, using the new syntax from the SQL:2023 standard


### **Advanced RAG with OCI Gen AI and 23ai** **_Estimated Time: 30 minutes_**

In this lab, you will learn how to use Oracle GenAI service and Oracle 23ai to perform Advanced RAG.


### Objectives

- How Oracle Gen AI service and Oracle 23ai can be used within LangChain framework
- How to leverage Oracle 23ai's AI Vector Search and Graph to perform Advanced RAG
- How to use Oracle GenAI service to create an chat that answers questions intelligently using private information stored in Oracle 23ai 
- Look at the multi-lingual capability of Oracle GenAI Service

**We are also going to use an AI Agent in the lab:**
- Langchain Agent Framework
- Structed Chat ReAct Agent
- Agent Tools
