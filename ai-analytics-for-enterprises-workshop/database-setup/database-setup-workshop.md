# Introduction

In this lab we will setup an Oracle Database. For this LiveLab, we will create an Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai (23ai always free ADB). All of the labs in this LiveLab and all of the features we are going to work with today are available and work on any 23ai database, regardless of the deployment style.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objective:
The objective of this workshop is to set up the 23ai always free ADB. The following steps will guide you through the simple installation.

### Prerequisites:
- Complete the Get Started Lab.
- Basic understanding of SQL is helpful.
